# day-45_web_scrape
Day 45 of 100.

Today, I gained exposure to web scraping. Using a website that has a top 100 films that people need to see, I scraped the data to get the information I was looking for. But they started the list from 100 and counted down to 1. So, made it go in the reverse order that way, number 1 would be at the top.

Then for every item in the list, each item was written into a text document.
